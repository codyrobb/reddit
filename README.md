My solution to the StockX coding challenge.

### Architecture
The architecture used in this challenge is MVVM-C mixed with a [state-container based approach](https://jobandtalent.engineering/ios-architecture-an-state-container-based-approach-4f1a9b00b82e).

### How to run
Just install the Cocoapods (`pod install`), open the workspace and run! Tests are included. ðŸ˜€
